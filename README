  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH := $(BUILD_DIR)/lib:$(LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
  LDFLAGS := "-L/opt/python3.4/lib"
  INSTALL_DIR := ~/.config/blender/2.76


On MacOSX:

  # On a MacOSX platform, uncomment these lines and adjust as needed:
  export PYTHON := /opt/local/bin/python3.4
  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH := $(BUILD_DIR)/lib:$(DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH)
  LDFLAGS := -L/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib
  INSTALL_DIR := ~/Library/Application\ Support/Blender/2.76

GAMer libraries and applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GAMer applications ImproveSurfMesh, MolecularMesh, and GenerateMesh are
built in the directory gamer_build_static/bin.  These applications reference
the GAMer libraries in gamer_build_static/lib.


PyGAMer
-------
PyGAMer is a Python wrapper of the core GAMer library. The gamer python module
is built in gamer_build_static/lib/python3.4/site-packages/gamer

Make sure to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac) and
PYTHONPATH before you run any programs or try using PyGAMer

  export BUILD_DIR=your_path_to/gamer_build_static
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$BUILD_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export PYTHONPATH=$BUILD_DIR/lib/python2.6/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

On Mac:

  export BUILD_DIR=your_path_to/gamer_build_static
  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$BUILD_DIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export PYTHONPATH=$BUILD_DIR/lib/python3.4/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH


To test the main functionality you can run the test script in gamer/swig/test.

  cd gamer/swig/test
  python gamer_test.py
